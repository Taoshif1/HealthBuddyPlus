**HealthBuddy+** is a modern, all-in-one wellness application designed to combat the fragmentation of health management. It brings together mood tracking, nutrition planning, community fitness challenges, and personal care into a single, cohesive, and user-friendly experience.

This project was built for the **Beginner Division** of the **Hack4Health Hackathon**.

## The Problem

In today's fast-paced world, managing our health is often overwhelming. We use one app for calorie counting, another for workout challenges, a third for tracking moods, and physical paper for our medical records. This fragmentation makes it difficult to see the full picture of our well-being and how these different areas of our health affect one another.

## Our Solution

HealthBuddy+ provides a unified and proactive approach to wellness. Instead of just logging data, our app acts as a true companion, offering a central hub for all your health needs and providing smart, actionable insights to guide you on your journey.
